## Course Overview  
This course was designed for first-year undergraduate students in the Art and Technology program at Qingdao Film Academy. It focused on the theory and creative approaches behind sound design in new media, with an emphasis on game sound and game music. The aim was to provide students with a solid theoretical foundation for future sound design work.

Throughout the course, I introduced and analyzed different categories of game sound, including environmental sound, interactive sound effects, and game music. Each of these categories was explored through case studies and practical examples, helping students understand the design processes behind various sound elements in games. We also delved into different stylistic approaches to game sound, such as Japanese game soundtracks, 8-bit aesthetics, and Western game sound design.

In addition to discussing these styles, I covered the technical workflows and creative techniques used by sound designers and composers in the industry. This included topics like how to craft immersive sound environments, how to design interactive sound systems that respond dynamically to player actions, and how to compose adaptive music that enhances the gameplay experience. Students were encouraged to critically analyze and deconstruct well-known games to better understand how sound and music contribute to storytelling, immersion, and gameplay.

By the end of the course, students were expected to have gained a comprehensive understanding of game audio design and were able to apply these insights to their own projects, preparing them for more advanced courses in sound design and interactive audio.

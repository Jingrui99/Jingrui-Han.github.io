### Course Overview
This course was specifically designed for undergraduate students in the Art and Technology program at the Beijing Film Academy's School of Sound. The focus was on designing interactive audio systems using the principles and techniques of Pure Data (Pd). The course was co-taught by Dr. Han Ke and myself.

Students learned how to use Pure Data to develop interactive audio systems that dynamically respond to user inputs and environmental changes. The course emphasized both the technical aspects of audio programming and the artistic elements of sound design. Students gained hands-on experience in creating audio experiences that adapt in real time to various interactions and contexts.

I covered creative concepts, development, and fundamental techniques in interactive audio, including patch creation, signal processing, and real-time synthesis. In the section focused on real-time audio processing with Pure Data, Dr. Han Ke provided technical insights into complex interactive audio systems. Additionally, we introduced innovative methods from leading practitioners and researchers in the field.

Students were encouraged to experiment with Pure Data to develop their own interactive audio projects. The course emphasized creativity and design thinking, guiding students to integrate their audio designs with gestures, live performances, and interactive media, pushing the boundaries of traditional sound design. By building on their knowledge of Pure Data, students were inspired to create unique and immersive audio experiences that enhance the interactivity of their projects.

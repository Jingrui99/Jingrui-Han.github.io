## Teaching Experience (Film Music Composition)  
8-week Lecture, Beijing Film Academy, School of Sound, Spring 2024  

### Course Overview  
This course was designed for third-year undergraduate students in the School of Sound at Beijing Film Academy. It primarily focused on the use of composition techniques and MIDI sequencing for scoring four types of screen music. These types include:  
1. Thematic Cues  
2. Rhythmic Tension Cues  
3. Transitional Cues  
4. Sound Design for Horror Music  

Throughout the course, students learned how to use MIDI sequencers to compose music that is highly synchronized with on-screen actions. They developed skills in expressing diverse emotions and creating various atmospheres in their scores. The course emphasized not only practical technical skills but also explored how to integrate traditional composition theories with modern sound design to further enhance the narrative and emotional impact of films.  

In the section of the course where I focused on sound design for horror music, I introduced key 20th-century composition techniques, including serial music, the sound explorations of *Ligeti*, and Schoenberg's atonal methods. Additionally, I highlighted the innovative approaches of Eastern composers in sound and structure. Through these lectures, I encouraged students to experiment with everyday objects and traditional instruments using unconventional playing techniques to discover new sound effects. They were also encouraged to embrace, but not be limited to, synthesizer sounds, and to find their own creative paths. Building on their existing knowledge of composition theory, students were inspired to break away from conventional sound design approaches, resulting in more impactful and immersive soundscapes for horror scenes.

### Course Overview
This course was tailored for third-year undergraduate students at the Beijing Film Academy's School of Sound. It centered on employing composition techniques and MIDI sequencing for scoring various types of screen music, including:

1.Thematic Cues
2.Rhythmic Tension Cues
3.Transitional Cues
4.Sound Design for Horror Music

Students learned to utilize MIDI sequencers to create music that is precisely synchronized with on-screen actions. The course fostered skills in expressing a range of emotions and crafting different atmospheres within their scores. Emphasis was placed not only on practical technical skills but also on integrating traditional composition theories with modern sound design to enhance the narrative and emotional impact of films.

In the segment focused on sound design for horror music, I introduced essential 20th-century composition techniques, such as serialism, Ligeti's sound explorations, and Schoenbergâ€™s atonal methods. I also highlighted innovative approaches from Eastern composers in sound and structure. Students were encouraged to experiment with everyday objects and traditional instruments using unconventional techniques to uncover new sound effects. They were guided to embrace synthesizer sounds while also exploring their own creative avenues. Building on their knowledge of composition theory, students were inspired to challenge conventional sound design methods, resulting in more immersive and impactful soundscapes for horror scenes.

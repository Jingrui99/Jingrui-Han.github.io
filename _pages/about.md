Welcome to my personal academic website! Below, you can find information about my background, professional experience, and portfolio.

# About Me

My name is **Jingrui Han (韩竞锐)**, and I am currently an Assistant Lecturer in Art & Technology, a film/game composer, interactive music designer, and sound designer. I also play the piano. I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Beijing Film Academy**, majoring in Composition and Composition Theory, with a focus on film music composition and production. Later, I pursued a master’s degree at the **Reid School of Music, University of Edinburgh**, specializing in **Sound Design**.

Currently, I teach at the **School of Recording Arts at Qingdao Film Academy**, with a focus on art and technology. From March to June 2024, I will be a **visiting scholar** at the Beijing Film Academy, conducting workshops and engaging in collaborative projects. I am passionate about the future of film and game music, particularly how new AI and interactive technologies will shape future musical styles and techniques.

In addition to my teaching, I work as an independent sound designer and film composer, collaborating with directors from Hong Kong and Beijing. Below are some examples of my work in the field of film and interactive music.
